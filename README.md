# official-website-server-backend

## Introduction

This project serves as the backend for two distinct frontend components of the official website: the **Admin** and **Web** interfaces. The **Admin** frontend handles user, news, and product management with role-based permissions, while the **Web** frontend showcases various sections of the website, including the home, news center, products and services, and an 'about us' page.
